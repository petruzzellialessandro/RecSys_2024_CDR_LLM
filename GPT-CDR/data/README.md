# Data Card

In the processed folder you will find the following datasets:

![plot](/figures/dataset_legend.png?raw=true)

We "marked" as **primary** the choice to test first, and as **secondary** the choice to test in case the first ones did not provide good results.

The **Name for base domain** column denotes the **files names** that we assigned to each partition that we computed starting from the base domain and the target domain Cut@x_y subsets.

You will find different folders containing the specific data computed starting from the Cut@x_y subset of the **BASE DOMAIN** data.

For example, the **Books2_5** folder only contains the partitions computed with Books2_5 as **BASE DOMAIN** combined with the selected **TARGET DOMAIN** data subsets.
